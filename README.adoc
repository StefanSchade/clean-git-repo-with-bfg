= Clean Git Repository with BFG
:repo-url: https://github.com/StefanSchade/clean-git-repo-with-bfg
:description: A small but convenient Docker setup that utilizes BFG Repo-Cleaner. Simplifies the process if you want to use this Unix tool from Windows.

== Description

`clean-git-repo-with-bfg` is a simple Docker setup that makes it easier to use the BFG Repo-Cleaner on Windows. BFG Repo-Cleaner is a powerful tool for removing large or sensitive files from Git history. This setup allows Windows users to leverage the tool without needing a Unix-like environment.

== Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed on your Windows machine
- Basic knowledge of Git and Docker
- A Git repository you need to clean

== Usage

Follow these steps to remove files from your Git history using this Docker setup:

=== Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to get the Dockerfile:

[source, shell]
-------
git clone https://github.com/StefanSchade/clean-git-repo-with-bfg.git
cd clean-git-repo-with-bfg
-------

=== Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

=== Step 3: Prepare Your Repository

Ensure your repository is cloned locally. If it’s not already cloned, do it now:

[source, shell]
-------
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
-------

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

=== Step 4: Run BFG Repo-Cleaner

Run the Docker container to clean your repository. Replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to your cloned repository:

[source, shell]
-------
docker run -v /path/to/your/repo:/repo bfg-repo-cleaner --delete-files your-file-to-remove /repo
-------

For example, if your repository is located at `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\REPOS\your-repo`, use

[source, shell]
-------
docker run -v /c/Users/YourName/Documents/REPOS/your-repo:/repo bfg-repo-cleaner --delete-files your-file-to-remove /repo
-------

=== Step 5: Clean Up the Repository

After running BFG Repo-Cleaner, you need to clean up the Git reflog and perform garbage collection:

[source, shell]
-------
cd /path/to/your/repo
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
-------

=== Step 6: Force Push the Changes

Finally, push the cleaned history back to your remote repository:

[source, shell]
-------
git push --force
-------

== Limitations and Implications

While using BFG Repo-Cleaner and rewriting Git history is powerful, it comes with important considerations:

- *Rewriting History*: This process changes the commit history. Anyone who has cloned or forked the repository will need to reclone it.
- *Force Push Required*: After cleaning, a force push is required to update the remote repository. Ensure you coordinate with collaborators to avoid disruption.
- *Data Removal*: Once removed, the data cannot be recovered from the repository. Double-check the files and commits you are removing to avoid accidental data loss.

== Motivation

Over time, large files or sensitive information can inadvertently be committed to a repository. Cleaning the history can reduce repository size, remove sensitive data, and ensure that the repository remains clean and efficient. Using this Docker setup makes it easier for Windows users to leverage BFG Repo-Cleaner, providing a convenient way to maintain a clean Git history.
